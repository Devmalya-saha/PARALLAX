        <h1>CREATION OF MARVEL</h1>
        <p>
            Marvel was started in 1939 by Martin Goodman as Timely Comics, and by 1951 had generally become known as Atlas Comics. The Marvel era began in 1961, the year that the company launched The Fantastic Four and other superhero titles created by Stan Lee, Jack Kirby, Steve Ditko and many others. The Marvel brand, which had been used over the years, was solidified as the company's primary brand.Marvel counts among its characters such well-known superheroes as Spider-Man, Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, Doctor Strange, Hulk, Wolverine, and Captain Marvel, as well as popular superhero teams such as the Avengers, the X-Men, the Fantastic Four, and the Guardians of the Galaxy. Its stable of well-known supervillains includes the likes of Doctor Doom, Magneto, Ultron, Thanos, Green Goblin, Galactus, Loki, and Kingpin. Most of Marvel's fictional characters operate in a single reality known as the Marvel Universe, with most locations mirroring real-life places; many major characters are based in New York City.

            The legendary Stan Lee (n√© Stanley Lieber) was a comic book writer, editor, and publisher up until his death on November 12, 2018. 

            The late president and chairman of Marvel comics left behind legacies of superheroes who were human, flawed, and relatable, and he was instrumental in helping to change the comic-book world.Lee was the mastermind behind Spider-Man, one of Marvel's most successful characters of all time.

            He created the character with artist Steve Ditko in 1962, and they wanted to introduce a unique hero that people could relate to.Lee also created the Incredible Hulk, and his alter ego, Dr. Bruce Banner, with Kirby in 1962.

            After being exposed to gamma rays during the detonation of an experimental bomb, Banner started transforming into a giant, angry green humanoid with incredible physical strength whenever he was going through emotional stress.The character was originally more reserved than Robert Downey Jr.'s popular portrayal of him, and Lee initially created him as a way to explore Cold War themes.

        <h1>THE RISE OF THE AVENGERS</h1>
        <p>
            After Osborn's Dark Avengers are exposed as criminals and their attack on Asgard was thwarted, the next iteration of the Avengers roster consists of Thor, Hawkeye, Spider-Man, Wolverine, Captain America, Spider-Woman, Iron Man, and team leader Maria Hill.Steve Rogers, briefly eschewing his Captain America persona, responds to Luke Cage's concerns about the team reverting to old methods by granting Cage's "New Avengers" recognition as an official team independent of Stark's more traditional Avengers. Bucky Barnes as Captain America joined the main Avengers, while Iron Fist, Power Woman, and the Thing joined Cage's team, Spider-Man and Wolverine maintaining dual membership in both teams. Rogers was an occasional presence and Victoria Hand was added as a government liaison for the New Avengers with Rogers's backing.
