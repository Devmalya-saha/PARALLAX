            <p>
                TED is a nonprofit devoted to spreading ideas, usually in the form of short, powerful talks (18 minutes
                or less). TED began in 1984 as a conference where Technology, Entertainment and Design converged, and
                today covers almost all topics — from science to business to global issues — in more than 100 languages.
                Meanwhile, independently run TEDx events help share ideas in communities around the world.

            <p>
                TED is a global community, welcoming people from every discipline and culture who seek a deeper
                understanding of the world. We believe passionately in the power of ideas to change attitudes, lives
                and, ultimately, the world. On TED.com, we're building a clearinghouse of free knowledge from the
                world's most inspired thinkers — and a community of curious souls to engage with ideas and each other,
                both online and at TED and TEDx events around the world, all year long.

            <h1>HOW WE CAME INTO EXISTENCE.</h1>
            <p>
                TED was born in 1984 out of Richard Saul Wurman's observation of a powerful convergence among three
                fields: technology, entertainment and design. The first TED, which he co-founded with Harry Marks,
                included a demo of the compact disc, the e-book and cutting-edge 3D graphics from Lucasfilm, while
                mathematician Benoit Mandelbrot demonstrated how to map coastlines using his developing theory of
                fractal geometry.

                But despite a stellar lineup, the event lost money, and it was six years before Wurman and Marks tried
                again. This time, in 1990, the world was ready. The TED Conference became an annual event in Monterey,
                California, attracting a growing and influential audience from many different disciplines united by
                their curiosity and open-mindedness -- and also by their shared discovery of an exciting secret. (Back
                then, TED was an invitation-only event. It is not now -- you're welcome and encouraged to apply to
                attend.)
